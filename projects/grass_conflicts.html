          <p>Grass Conflicts is a minigame based on Turf Wars from Mineplex.<br>It's a team based game, where the objective is to take over the entire enemy team's turf.<br><br>Your team gets 1 line of turf when an enemy dies, and as the game goes on, this number grows higher and higher.<br>You may only place and break blocks on your side of the turf.<br>Similarly to Turf Wars, you can build on your team's side during peace (Grass) phase, and fight only during the fighting (Conflicts) phase.</p>

          <p>If you're wondering why it's called Grass Conflicts, it's an inside joke between my friends. I googled synonyms for the words "turf" and "wars", and picked the first two words that came up. And thus, Grass Conflicts was born.</p>

            <h2>Coding Process</h2>
            <p>I challenged myself to create this project in under a week, and it has helped me a lot in understanding how to write minigame plugins, and how to work with Kotlin.<br>There are a lot of things I'd have done differently in hindsight, and lessons I've learned that I've taken with me to my next projects.<br><br>I used the <a href="https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/fastasyncworldedit.13932/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">FAWE API</a> to handle large block update operations such as: Removing blocks, moving the red line and resetting the map.<br><br>For storing data in items (such as uses left), I used Paper's <a href="https://docs.papermc.io/paper/dev/pdc" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Persistent Data Container (PDC)</a>.</p>
