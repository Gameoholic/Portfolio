          <p>Lumber Defense is a PVE Minigame plugin.<br>Your objective is to survive attacks from mobs, and to defend your tree.<br>Some mobs (marked with a sapling in their name) only target the tree, and should be dealt with quickly.<br>Other mobs will attack you and try to slow you down.<br>You can watch the full playthrough video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHmi_LbGW9w" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a>.<br><br>
          The tree starts with 20 health, and can be healed using bone meal for 10% of its max health. Bone meal is obtained as a rare drop from mobs.<br>The tree's max health can be upgraded by placing down a bone block. Bone blocks are obtained from boss waves (every 5 waves).</p>

          </div>

          <p>Adding a strategic layer to the game, players can intentionally chop down the tree and decrease its health to acquire Lumber - a crucial currency allowing the purchase of powerful items and upgrades. This introduces a dilemma where lowering the tree's health becomes a calculated decision that is both risky and rewarding.</p>
