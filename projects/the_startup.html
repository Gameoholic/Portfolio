          <p>The Startup is an event that I made for the server TopStrix while working for them as a developer.<br>It was made in collaboration with Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, with the primary goal of educating young individuals about entrepreneurship, startups and fostering creativity.</p>
          <h2>How does it work?</h2>
          <p>The event was split into 4 weeks, each week having different startup categories and tasks.<br>You would talk to David Ben Gurion, mascot of the university, and select a startup category <i>(Design & Style, Fashion, Cyber, etc.)</i>.<br>You would then be given a list of tasks, seen in chat and on the scoreboard. The tasks are all vanilla Minecraft, but have to do with the startup category (for example, collect 5 space suits, which are iron chestplates). You would then venture out into the survival world to complete them.<br>The scoreboard updates dynamically when you progress through your tasks.</p>

          </div>
        
          <p>After finishing with all your tasks, you can head back to David and receive a book, in which you will write your startup idea according to the guidelines explained in the spawn area signs.</p>

            <p>Submitting your startup idea</p>
          </div>


          <p>After you submitted your startup idea, it was saved to the database to be reviewed by the University. After finishing, you were able to read other people's startups, and invest in them.<br>By investing in a startup, you would receive a small prize if the startup you invested in won.</p>

          <p>There were 10 winners in total every week, which received a prize and a rank.<br>The game would reset at the end of every week, and the winners were displayed near spawn.</p>

            <h2>From a Technical Viewpoint</h2>
            <p>The event was played by over 3,000 unique players, and had 16,000 logins in the first week alone.<br>The plugin was written completely by me, and had to support hundreds of players at a time, and database operations.</p>
            
            <h3>Handling player data</h3>
            <p>The player data was fetched upon login and cached in memory. It was saved upon logging out, on important operations (finishing a task, or submitting your startup), or every 5 minutes.<br>In case of a database failure, the player was sent a message and kicked, to prevent further progress loss.</p>

            <h3>Tasks & Configuration</h3>
            <p>The plugin is 100% customizable (which is why I was able to translate it to English for the showcase videos on this page), including strings, tasks and various other settings.<br>Below are a couple examples of tasks, taken from the config file:</p>
            <pre>
              <code>
                - kill-specific-mobs:
                  amount-required: 100
                  type: "CHICKEN"
                - craft-specific-items:
                  amount-required: 32
                  material: "REDSTONE_LAMP"
                - kill-any-mobs:
                  amount-required: 100
              </code>
            </pre>
