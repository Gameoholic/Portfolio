          <p>Fancy2FA is a 2 factor authentication plugin I made primarly as a learning experience.<br>When logging on for the first time, you will be prompted to create an authentication method for yourself (Discord, security questions or a password). The data is then hashed, salted and peppered, and stored in a MySQL database.<br><br>When logging back on, you will be frozen in place, until you pass one of the authentication methods.</p>

            <h2>From a Technical Viewpoint</h2>
            <p class="archived-warning">Note: This project is archived, meaning the code is not in the best state, there are other projects whose code I'm more proud of.</p>
            <p>This was a learning project of mine, which helped me learn how to work with MySQL, Kotlin, NMS, ktor and the Discord API without using an API wrapper. It's not intended to be used in production, as it wasn't tested for vulnerabilities and might have exploits. NMS was used for the sign UI, and ktor was used for webserver for the Discord authentication.<br><br>In hindsight, I would have done things differently - Discord OAuth2 shouldn't be used for user authentication - better to use an actual Discord bot. This plugin was also the first time I'd created menus, and my menu system could've been written better.<br>All in all, it was a nice project and I learned a lot from it.
